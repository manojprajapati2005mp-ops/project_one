🌦️ Advanced Weather Widget (Glassmorphism UI)
1. A modern, responsive weather application built using pure HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
2. This project provides real-time weather data, dynamic animated backgrounds, and a glassmorphism interface, all packed into a single, deployable HTML file

✨ Features
1. 🔍 Search weather by city, region, or postcode
2. 📍 Automatic location detection (GPS → IP fallback)
3. 🌡️ Displays temperature (°C / °F) and feels-like temperature
4. 💧 Shows humidity, wind speed, and air quality (PM2.5)
5. 🎨 Dynamic animated background that changes with weather & temperature
6. 🧊 Glassmorphism UI with smooth gradients and blur effects
7. 📱 Fully responsive (desktop, tablet, mobile)
8. ♿ Accessible with ARIA roles and screen-reader support
9. ⚡ No frameworks — pure vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript

🛠️ Technologies Used
1. HTML5 – semantic structure & accessibility
2. CSS3 – glassmorphism, gradients, animations & responsive design
3. JavaScript (ES6+) – API handling, DOM updates, async/await
4. WeatherAPI – real-time weather data

📸 Preview
1. The UI automatically adapts its background based on:
2. Sunny / Clear
3. Cloudy / Overcast
4. Rain / Snow / Storm
5. Hot / Cold temperature

🚀 How It Works
1. User enters a location (city, region, or postcode)
2. App fetches live data from WeatherAPI
3. Weather data is parsed and displayed instantly
4. Background animation updates dynamically based on:
5. Weather condition
6. Temperature range
7. If no city is entered:
8. App attempts GPS location
9. Falls back to IP-based location
